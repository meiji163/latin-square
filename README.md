# latin-squares

Experimenting based on Question 3.3 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14795 

Proper edge colorings of K_n correspond to symmetric latin squares when n is odd (see https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2511611/201018)

Some symmetric Latin squares up to isomorphism can be found here for n=7 https://users.monash.edu.au/~iwanless/data/symmetricLS/symmetricLS.html
